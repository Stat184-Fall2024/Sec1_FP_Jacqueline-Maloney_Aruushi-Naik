## Introduction

Disney+ and Netflix are two of the most well-known streaming services in the world, providing millions of users with access to a vast variety of TV series and films. We conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the films and television series that are available on Netflix and Disney+ in this analysis. Given the dynamic nature of digital entertainment, knowing how content trends and patterns have changed over time offers important insights regarding platform expansion, production strategy, and consumer preferences.

Key patterns in Disney+ and Netflix content will be examined in this analysis, such as variations in the number of movies and TV shows each year, average running times, regional production distribution, content ratings, etc. Disney+ and Netflix's future content choices and marketing plans will be influenced by the insights this analysis provides into consumer preferences, strategic planning for content, and platform evolution.

## The broader research question for our analysis is :

#### What trends and patterns can be observed in Disney Plus and Netflix TV shows and movies?

## Dataset Overview

To address the research question, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of the Disney+ and Netflix data sets, examining various aspects of the content offered on both platforms.

```{r}
#| echo: False
#| message: False

# Load the necessary packages 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: False

# Load the Disney+ & Netflix data from the provided URL
disney_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT2CVS1o_R5Dq-ATuNlVRInKOWHG9O-efVB-pbX6Az6JuS8LJWqC6AqCN2sRFRKelzMCv0CTpEbDJ7l/pub?gid=381939166&single=true&output=csv"

disney_data <- read.csv(disney_url)

netflix_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRhYpV_lEupTdc9VgHeH2814QtwaoMFJRo3LaAamu7mEh8RuCCXRxRRBPI1AeDHnlqciskbtH8N9xmm/pub?gid=944899422&single=true&output=csv"

netflix_data <- read.csv(netflix_url)
```

Disney+ Data Preview

```{r}
#| echo: False

# Preview Disney+ (first 10 entries) with truncated text and adjusted font size for the table cells
head(disney_data, 10) %>%
  # Truncate character columns
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~str_trunc(., width = 15, ellipsis = "..."))) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:12, width = "1cm") %>%  #Adjust column width
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, font_size = 4.5)%>% # Adjust header font size
  kable_styling(font_size = 6) #Modify cell font size
```

Netflix Data Preview

```{r}
#| echo: False

# Preview Netflix the data
# Preview Disney+ (first 10 entries) with truncated text and adjusted font size for the table cells
head(netflix_data, 10) %>%
  # Truncate character columns
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~str_trunc(., width = 15, ellipsis = "..."))) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:12, width = "1cm") %>%  #Adjust column width
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, font_size = 4.5)%>% # Adjust header font size
  kable_styling(font_size = 6) #Modify cell font size

```

The tables above were built using the head() method and display the first few values from the data sets. It provides a quick preview of the data set's structure, column names, and value types, which is important for understanding the data's overall format and content.

Disney+ Data Summary

```{r}
#| echo: False

# Summarize Disney+ the data
summary(disney_data) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:12, width = "1cm") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, font_size = 4.5) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 6)%>%
  column_spec(1, extra_css = "text-align: left;")
```

Netflix Data Summary

```{r}
#| echo: False

# Summarize Netflix the data
summary(netflix_data) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:12, width = "1cm") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, font_size = 4.5) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 5)%>%
  column_spec(1, extra_css = "text-align: left;")
```

Additionally, we used the summary() function to create a summary table. Each column in the data data frame is summarized in the table that is shown above.

## Data Cleaning and Wrangling

To streamline the analysis, the datasets for Disney+ and Netflix were merged into a single dataset. This joining process ensures a consistent structure for comparative analysis and enables efficient exploration of trends across both the platforms.

```{r}
#| echo: True 

# Add a platform column to the Disney+ dataset 
disney_plus <- disney_data %>%
  mutate(platform = "Disney Plus")
# Add a platform column to the Netflix dataset
netflix <- netflix_data %>%
  mutate(platform = "Netflix")
# Join the two datasets 
moviesandtv <- bind_rows(disney_plus, netflix)
```

Upon looking at the *moviesandtv* dataset, we came across empty cells and decided to replace it with N/A values to account for missing data. This would maintain uniformity throughout the dataset and allow for more accurate analysis by clearly identifying missing information across the Disney+ and Netflix datasets.

```{r}
#| echo: False 

# Add N/A values to replace missing data 
moviesandtv <- moviesandtv %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(., "")))
```

To facilitate targeted analysis for each type of content, we separated the *moviesandtv* dataset into two distinct tables: one for movies and one for TV shows. For movies, we changed the format for duration by removing the "min" label, while for TV shows, we converted the number of seasons into integers to ensure clear and specific analysis of content.

```{r}
#| echo: False 

#Separate the moviesandtv table into two distinct tables 

movies <- moviesandtv %>%
  filter(type == 'Movie') %>% # Filter the type column 
  mutate(duration = as.integer(str_remove(duration, " min"))) # Remove the string 'min' and only keep the integer 

tvshows <- moviesandtv %>%
  filter(type == 'TV Show') %>% # Filter the type column 
  mutate(duration = str_replace(duration, "Seasons", "Season")) %>% # Replace the Seasons to Season  
  mutate(duration = as.integer(str_remove(duration, " Season"))) # Remove the string 'Season' and only keep the integer 
```

TV Shows Data

```{r}
#| echo: False 
head(tvshows, 10) %>%
  # Truncate character columns
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~str_trunc(., width = 15, ellipsis = "..."))) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:12, width = "0.95cm") %>%  #Adjust column width
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, font_size = 4.5)%>% # Adjust header font size
  kable_styling(font_size = 5) #Modify cell font size
```

The above table showcases the TV Shows dataset which contains data from both the platforms.

Movies Data

```{r}
#| echo: False 
head(movies, 10) %>%
  # Truncate character columns
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~str_trunc(., width = 15, ellipsis = "..."))) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:12, width = "0.95cm") %>%  #Adjust column width
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, font_size = 4.5)%>% # Adjust header font size
  kable_styling(font_size = 5) #Modify cell font size
```

The above table showcases the Movies dataset which contains data from both the platforms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

### How many TV shows and movies from a specific year are available on Netflix and Disney+ ?

#### TV Shows

```{r}
#| echo: False
#| message: False


### How many TV shows and movies from a specific year are available on Disney+ and Netflix ?

# For TV Shows 
# Step 1: Wrangle the TV shows dataset 
# Filter the dataset to include only TV shows released between 1950 and 2025
tv_trend <- tvshows %>% 
  filter(release_year >= 1990 & release_year <= 2025) %>%
  group_by(platform, release_year) %>% # Group by platform and release year
  summarise(count = n()) # Count the number of TV shows 

# Step 2: Create the trend line plot
ggplot(tv_trend, aes(x = release_year, y = count, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + # Create bar plot with grouped bars
  labs( title = "Number of TV Shows on Netflix vs. Disney+ from a particular year",
    x = "Release Year",
    y = "Number of TV Shows",
    fill = "Streaming Platforms" ) + # Add titles, labels, and key for the plot
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Disney Plus" = "blue", "Netflix" = "red")) + # Set custom colors
  theme_minimal() + # Add a clean theme 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") # Positions the legend at the bottom of the plot
```

The bar chart illustrates a number of TV series that are accessible on Netflix and Disney+ from each particular year. When it comes to TV shows selection, Netflix constantly outperforms Disney+, especially after the 2000s, which is an indication of its larger selection of TV shows from the year 2000 to 2021. Netflix's content strength is demonstrated its peak at 436 TV shows from the year 2020 alone. Disney+, on the other hand, peaks at 55 TV shows from the year 2021 but still lags behind Netflix. It is interesting to note that Netflix still surpasses Disney+ in 2021 despite a minor decline in TV series from that year. This confirms Netflix's domination in the market by showing that it offers a wider range of TV shows than Disney+.

#### Movies

```{r}
#| echo: False 
#| message: False


# For Movies 
# Step 1: Wrangle the Movies dataset 
# Filter the dataset to include only Movies released between 1950 and 2025
movie_trend <- movies %>%
  filter(release_year >= 1990 & release_year <= 2025) %>%
  group_by(platform, release_year) %>% # Group by platform and release year
  summarise(count = n()) # Count the number of movies

# Step 2: Create the bar graph plot
ggplot(movie_trend, aes(x = release_year, y = count, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + # Create bar plot with grouped bars
  labs( title = "Number of Movies on Netflix vs. Disney+ from a particular year",
    x = "Release Year",
    y = "Number of Movies",
    fill = "Streaming Platforms") + # Add titles, labels, and key for the plot
  scale_fill_manual( values = c("Disney Plus" = "blue", "Netflix" = "red")) + # Set custom colors
  theme_minimal()+ # Add a clean theme 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  # Positions the legend at the bottom of the plot  
```

The bar chart shows the quantity of films that have been made available on Netflix and Disney+ throughout time. In terms of movie collection, Netflix significantly surpasses Disney+ since 1990. Netflix demonstrates its extensive content library by reaching its pinnacle in 2018 and 2019 movies, with 767 films annually. But after these years, Netflix sees a drop in movie content, much like their TV show patterns. Disney+, in contrast, has a relatively smaller collection of movies, but it has been steadily growing with its content from the recent years, reaching a peak of 74 films from 2020. Netflix's dominance in the movie streaming market is highlighted by this trend, although Disney+ is progressively growing its collection, especially with more recent movies.

### What is the average duration of movies and TV shows?

#### TV Shows

```{r}
#| echo: False
#| message: False

### What is the average duration of movies and TV shows on Disney+ and Netflix?
# For TV Shows 
# Step 1: Wrangle the TV Shows dataset 
average_duration_tv <- tvshows %>%
  group_by(platform) %>% # Group by platform
  summarise(avg_seasons = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE)) # Calculate mean number of seasons

# Step 2: Plot the bar graph plot
ggplot(average_duration_tv, aes(x = platform, y = avg_seasons, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +  # Create a bar plot
  labs(title = "Average Seasons of TV Shows on Netflix vs. Disney+",
    x = "Platform",
    y = "Average Number of Seasons" ) + # Add titles, labels, and key for the plot
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Disney Plus" = "blue", "Netflix" = "red")) + # Set custom colors
  theme_minimal() + # Add a clean theme 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  # Positions the legend at the bottom of the plot 
```

The average number of seasons for Netflix and Disney+ TV series is compared in the plot. It illustrates that, in contrast to Netflix, which normally offers shows with fewer than two seasons, Disney+ usually offers shows with a greater average number of seasons - 2 or more. Disney+'s emphasis on family-friendly franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Disney Channel series—which frequently have several seasons to appeal to younger viewers who prefer longer-running series—is in line with this trend. Netflix, on the other hand, appeals to a wider audience, including elderly viewers who might like short stories, by offering a varied mix of original content and shorter series.

#### Movies

```{r}
#| echo: False
#| message: False

# For Movies 
# Step 1: Wrangle the Movies dataset 
average_duration_movies <- movies %>%
  group_by(platform) %>% # Group by platform
  summarise(avg_time = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE)) #Calculate mean number of time

# Step 2: Plot the bar plot 
ggplot(average_duration_movies, aes(x = platform, y = avg_time, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +  # Create a bar plot
  labs( title = "Average Time of Movies on Netflix vs. Disney+",
    x = "Platform",
    y = "Average Time (mins) of Movies"
  ) + # Add titles, labels, and key for the plot
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Disney Plus" = "blue", "Netflix" = "red")) + # Set custom colors
  theme_minimal() + # Add a clean theme 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  # Positions the legend at the bottom of the plot 
```

The plot compares with the average running times of Netflix and Disney+ films. It demonstrates that the average runtime of Netflix films is higher i.e. 99 minutes than that of Disney+ films i.e. 71 minutes. This variation can be explained by Netflix's emphasis on a wide variety of movies, including highly regarded, award-winning productions which typically entail lengthier running periods. Furthermore, Netflix offers a greater selection of adult-oriented live-action movies, which are usually lengthier in length. Disney+, on the other hand, concentrates more on animation and franchise films aimed at younger audiences, which are typically shorter in order to keep viewers' attention spans intact. The two platforms' different target audiences and content strategies are reflected in this trend.

### Which directors are most frequently featured on Disney+?

#### TV Shows

```{r}
#| echo: False
#| message: False

### Which directors are most frequently featured on Disney+ and Netflix?
# For TV shows 
# Step 1 : Wrangle the TV shows dataset 
director_data_tv <- tvshows %>%
  filter(!is.na(director)) %>% # Remove rows with NA in the director column
  separate_rows(director, sep = ",") %>% # Separate rows with a separator
  group_by(platform, director) %>% # Group by platform and director 
  summarise(count = n()) # Count the number of rows 

# Step 2: Get the top directors for each platform
top_directors_tv <- director_data_tv %>%
  group_by(platform) %>% # Group by platform 
  top_n(10, count) %>% # Select top 10 directors by count
  ungroup() # Ungroup the data

# Step 3: Plot the bar data
ggplot(top_directors_tv, aes(x = reorder(director, count), y = count, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + # Create a bar plot 
  coord_flip() + # Flipping coordinates for better readability
  labs(title = "Top Tv Shows Directors on Disney+ and Netflix",
    x = "Director",
    y = "Number of TV Shows",
    fill = "Streaming Platform" ) + # Add titles, labels, and key for the plot
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Disney Plus" = "blue", "Netflix" = "red")) + # Set custom colors
  theme_minimal()+ # Add a clean theme 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  # Positions the legend at the bottom of the plot 
```

The top ten TV show directors on Netflix and Disney+ can be seen in the graph. Given that Disney+ has no directors included in the data set (only "NA" values are present), it is evident from the plot that all of the top directors in the graph are connected to Netflix. With three TV shows each available on Netflix, directors Ken Burns and Alastair Fothergill are clearly the most significant contributors. This implies that Netflix features a wider variety of content from a wider spectrum of directors. A data set restriction in the Disney+ data set is the reason for the lack of directors for Disney+.

#### Movies

```{r}
#| echo: False
#| message: False

# For movies 
# Step 1 : Wrangle the Movies dataset 
director_data_movies <- movies %>%
  filter(!is.na(director)) %>% # Remove rows with NA in the director column
  group_by(platform, director) %>% # Group by platform and director
  summarise(count = n()) # Count the number of rows 

# Step 2: Get the top directors for each platform
top_directors <- director_data_movies %>%
  group_by(platform) %>% # Group by platform 
  top_n(10, count) %>% # Select top 10 directors by count
  ungroup() # Ungroup the data

# Step 3: Plot the data
ggplot(top_directors, aes(x = reorder(director, count), y = count, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) + # Bar plot without legend
  coord_flip() + # Flip coordinates for better readability
  labs(title = "Top Movie Directors on Disney+ vs. Netflix",
    x = "Director",
    y = "Number of Movies",
    fill = " Streaming Platform" ) + # Add titles, labels, and key for the plot
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Disney Plus" = "blue", "Netflix" = "red") ) + # Set custom colors
  theme_minimal() + # Add a clean theme 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") # Positions the legend at the bottom of the plot 

```

The top ten film directors on Netflix and Disney+ are shown in the graph. It shows that Rajiv Chilaka, whose 19 films are available on Netflix, is Netflix's main dominator. On the other side, Jack Hanna is in charge of Disney+, which offers 17 films that he has directed. This demonstrates a considerable difference between the movie selections on the two platforms, with Netflix displaying a greater number of Chilaka-directed productions. Hanna makes a substantial contribution to Disney+. The plot emphasizes how different the kinds of films that are available on each platform are, with Netflix providing a wider selection of filmmakers and genres.

### What is the regional distribution of Disney+ content (based on country/region of production)?

```{r}
#| echo: False
distribution <- moviesandtv%>%
  group_by(platform,country)%>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups="drop")%>%
  arrange(desc(count))%>%
  filter(!is.na(country))%>%
  slice_head(n=15)

ggplot(distribution, aes(x = reorder(country, count), y = count, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Regional Distribution of Content on Disney+ and Netflix",
    x = "Country/Region",
    y = "Number of Titles",
    fill = "Platform"
  )+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1) ) # Adjust label position
```

```{r}
#| echo: False

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

disney_distribution <- moviesandtv %>%
  filter(platform == "Disney Plus") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 15)

netflix_distribution <- moviesandtv %>%
  filter(platform == "Netflix") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 15)


ggplot(disney_distribution, aes(x = reorder(country, count), y = count, fill = "Disney Plus")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Regional Distribution of Content on Disney+",
    x = "Country/Region",
    y = "Number of Titles",
    fill = "Platform"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
  )



ggplot(netflix_distribution, aes(x = reorder(country, count), y = count, fill = "Netflix")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Regional Distribution of Content on Netflix",
    x = "Country/Region",
    y = "Number of Titles",
    fill = "Platform"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
  )

```

### Is there a trend in content ratings? For instance, does Disney Plus predominantly feature family-friendly content, or is there a growing inclusion of mature-rated titles?

```{r}
#| echo: False

ratings <- moviesandtv %>%
  filter(!grepl("min", rating))%>%
  group_by(platform, rating) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

ggplot(ratings, aes(x = reorder(rating, count), y = count, fill = platform)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Disney Plus" = "blue", "Netflix" = "red")) +
  labs(
    title = "Content Ratings on Disney Plus and Netflix",
    x = "Rating",
    y = "Number of Titles",
    fill = "Platform"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
  )
```

Disney Plus tailors to a younger audience whereas Netflix tailors to teens and young adults.

### Outside the US, where are most of Disney+ movies and TV Shows produced?

### Date added to Disney Plus - Are the movies newer to Disney or have been on the platform for a long time?
